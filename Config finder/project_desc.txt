--- This is a document that will explain the script ---

In the script, I used the built-in libraries re and json. The purpose of this script was to take 
a configuration file from an Audiocodes device, find the VLANs that had GLBP configured on it, 
in particular, that had an IP address that started with '100.111'. The other information I needed
was GLBP ID, the description of the VLAN interface, the VLAN ID, and the GLBP virtual IP.

I used the re library to create regular expressions and filter the config file using the regex. 
The json library was used to make the returned data more readable.

The regular expression I created was to filter through the configuration file, and search for 
the data I stated above. The expression is prefixed by the r option. This is so the string can be
processed as a raw string, and the \ not be a special character, for example, \n doesn't mean 
newline.

I opened the file where the config file was at, used utf-8 encoding because there were some 
characters there that ASCII could not understand. Used the the reading mode, because I did not 
want to make changes to the config file, instead I wanted to push the returned values out to 
a different file. After grabbing the file, Python had needs to read the file, then apply the 
regex to the contents of the file, using re's findall() function. I used the flag IGNORECASE 
just in case there were instances of case mismatches.

I took the returned value, ran it through the json dumps() function to make it look pretty, then 
I created a new file using the mode 'w'. I wrote the pretty returned text to the new file, the 
closed the file.
